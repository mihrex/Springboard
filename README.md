house prices using Machine learning models and data visualisations using python. The code is
available in the form of python notebook. The data set for this problem along with all of its
statistical details is available at Kaggle Link. The dataset contains price record
of different houses in Kings County, USA.Based on certain features of the house, such as the
area in square feet, the condition of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number

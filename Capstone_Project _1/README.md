#PREDICTING HOUSE PRICE

###Introduction
Over the past few decades, the housing price has shown increments as times goes by. It is no doubt that the longer the period of time the higher the price of housing. This is a big issue to be taken into consideration. It is considered an important issue because house is one of the important basic human needs. Therefore, being concerned about the housing price is a must and the factors that contribute to the increase of housing price need to be determined.
The following are the objectives of this project:
1. To determine the causes of increase in housing price.
2. To predict the price of housing price in the future.
3. To identify the effect of increase in housing price


###Overview of Data 
This project illustrates different approaches to predict house prices using machine learning tools and forecasting algorithms to uncover what really influences the value of a house and achieve the high degree of accuracy in my model. The original dataset can be found Link , in the Kaggle website. This dataset will allow us to learn more about the Housing market and to explore more deeply the most popular machine learning techniques, as well as learning more about the necessary steps to follow in a data science project


###Significance of the Problem
 By doing prediction on the housing price, the factors that lead to the increase of housing price can be determined. The housing price in the future can be forecasted as well. The importance of doing this proposal on the housing price is that, it will give positive impact to the government. It can help the government to predict or estimates the price of housing in the future. These can wider the awareness of the price of housing which is now in high rate. This research will also can be an advantage for the housing developers in determining the housing price by identification of the factors that lead to the housing price estimation. Moreover, this prediction is also important to individuals who will purchase house in the future. This will give awareness to the individual regarding the housing price and help them to figure out the best decision in purchasing a house.
 
 ###Deliverable
The deliverables will be the codes and visualization techniques on GitHub in the form of Jupyter Notebooks, and a slide desk. This will include a report and I intend to write a documentation explaining the code and the results.

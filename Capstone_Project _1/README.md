# Predicting-House-Price

This repository consists of python notebook which explains the process of predicting the 
house prices using Machine learning models and data visualisations using python. The code is
available in the form of python notebook. The data set for this problem along with all of its
statistical details is acquired through Kaggle. The dataset contains price record
of different houses in Kings County, USA. Based on certain features of the house, such as the
area in square feet, the condition of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number
of floors, year of built, I have tried to predict the estimated price of the house.
